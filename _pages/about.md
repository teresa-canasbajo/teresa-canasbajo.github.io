I am a 4th PhD candidate in Vision Science at the University of California, Berkeley. I am a Fulbright scholar since 2017, sponsored by the Spain-US Fulbright Comission. My current work focuses on attention, eye movement and face perception research. I am passionate about using data to understand real-world problems.
