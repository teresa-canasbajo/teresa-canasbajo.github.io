## Investigating drivers' attention in manual and autonomous vehicles.

This project is sponsored by Berkeley Deep Drive. 
The recent advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in the last decade has changed the traditional role of drivers, from being fully responsible of all driving functions to adopting a supervising role in an AV. As of today, AVs are not perfect systems, they may make mistakes and require the driver to take control. Drivers must then monitor the AV behaviors to ensure safety of such technology. During this year’s BDD-sponsored project, we found that drivers’ attention shifted when they were monitoring an AV compared to when they were actually driving a manual car. In particular, drivers’ attention while monitoring an AV was more distributed across the visual field.

The goal of the proposed project for this year is to investigate whether this shift in drivers’ attention in AVs comes from an increased tendency to look at driving-irrelevant or salient, distracting areas. To this purpose, we propose to use our previously developed framework comparing drivers’ gaze in a driving simulator in different degrees of car automation. If drivers in AVs are in fact spending more time looking at distracting, driving-irrelevant areas, then we can use the influence of these areas in drivers’ attention through eye movements as a measure of drivers’ awareness and distraction. A driving monitoring system could be then developed based on these findings to alert drivers to maintain attention when their level of distraction increases.
