Measuring viewers’ experiences of films has become a critical issue for fi lmmakers because all kinds of audiences now have access to new
releases from all over the world. Some approaches have focused on the cognitive level of the experience, while others have emphasized the structure
of films. Additionally, some have used quantitative objective methods to examine audience reactions to short film sequences, while others have applied
qualitative approaches to study feature-length fi lms. However, an integrated method that combines the features of these approaches is needed. In this article, we describe a new method that combines quantitative and qualitative data to study viewers’ experiences of different structural features of fi lms. This
method involves an online subjective response mechanism that can be used to capture and measure the experiences of different target audiences as they
watch movies of different lengths.
